n = 10^8 test cases = time 1sec
n = 10^7 O(n)
n = 10^6 O(n*log(n))
n = 10^4 O(n^n)
From the help of above lines we decide which algo should be opted. 

Optimization ->
- Proper use of access modifiers, public - main and solver class | final keyword
- Don't use Scanner class
- avoid object creation
- using inbuilt library functions
