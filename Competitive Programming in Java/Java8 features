                            (https://www.journaldev.com/2389/java-8-features-with-examples)
Convert large array into Stream 
Arrays.stream(arr).sum
Arrays.stream.parallelSort()
Arrays.average and many more...
Arrays.stream().parallel().max()
Integer.MIN_VALUE
BigInteger class is immutable
- mod / modInverse
- multiply, divide, add, subtract

Streams in Java is a new feature included since Java 8.
 Streams provide a string API whose methods can be used on collections in Java. In this tutorial, 
 we have seen stream methods that work on Java arrays. 
 We have also seen the other features that were added to Java arrays in Java 8 edition.

One of them is stream while the other is the parallelSort method that sorts an array in a parallel manner. 
This method is faster than the linear method sort, 
which was evident in the program where we compared both the methods.
